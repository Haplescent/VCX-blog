(3/17/21)</strong></p><p>Venture capitalists need to be seen as thought leaders, and content is the way to make that happen. Some VCs are even starting their own publishing platforms. But creating compelling original content isn't easy. Harder still is creating content that will spread far and wide. Or is it? Influencers are using their powerful communities to promote content and to drive up the value of everything from startups to SPACs to&mldr;you guessed it&mldr; NFTs! The meteoric rise of NFTs in recent months gives tantalizing clues as to how ideas spread through the Valley and beyond. Deeper still, NFT's present a new way to value content and create revenue for content creators.</p><p>Join us on 3/17 at 6:30 PM Pacific for a deep dive into content and NFTs.

Large dots interact/are interacted with more in tweets than small dots. If an arrow points towards someone, it means that this person was mentioned (can be just a 'mention', a retweet, or a reply to your tweet). The people doing the tweeting about NFTs are at the origin of the arrows. This is not representing the flow of the Tweets themselves. For instance, "JoinClubhouse" does not necessarily tweet a lot about NFTs, but rather it is get tagged often in tweets about NFTs.</p><p><strong>&mdash;</strong></p><p><strong>VC Marketing Jam #1 (3/2/21)</strong></p><p>Our inaugural conversion on marketing for venture capital, led by Kristen Ostro and Brian Dema, and a group of VC marketers, platform experts and data scientists.</p><p>We the rising importance of personal branding for VC partners, and the need for authenticity.

Key figures are below (contact us if you would like the full study). We used a number of data science techniques (including principle component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization for topic analysis and clustering - that's a mouthful!) to determine how information flows through this sample VC network in Twitter.</p><p>We have developed a concept called "information centrality", which is a measure for how well tweets propagated throughout the secondary network surrounding these VCs. This methodology presents an intriguing way to map the venture capital conversation online. We are currently working to expand this analysis across the entire VC community globally.</p><p>We are already findings results on how various VCs perform in terms of engagement, including which VCs may be underperforming given their community size. Even more interesting is where this data will lead&mldr; we are already seeing connections to important diversity issues facing venture, as well as trends in word usage which exemplify the VC "echo chamber". See this <a href=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/explore-175-years-of-words-in-scientific-american/>Scientific American article</a>for an interesting use case of a similar types of topic analysis.</p><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/M73FyVc/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-11-04-51-PM.png alt></p><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/h8CndXw/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-11-04-56-PM.png alt></p><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/y4kdbMR/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-11-05-02-PM.png alt></p><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/71wrr2j/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-11-05-10-PM.png alt></p><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/wCqdRGK/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-11-05-17-PM.png alt></p><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/vc6hpc0/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-11-05-22-PM.png alt></p><p>Other interesting findings include:</p><ul><li>7:00 PM Pacific is apparently the best time to Tweet with this audience.</li></ul><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/dP6HTTG/image.png alt></p><ul><li>Original content may be overrated - retweets get retweeted MUCH more often than original tweets.</li></ul><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/MPvDm9t/image-1.png alt></p><ul><li>Likes and retweet count correlate strongly with each other.</li></ul><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/7KByKzb/image-7.png alt></p><ul><li>The relationship between follower count and tweet engagements is not linear. Some firms (perhaps Kleiner) could be relatively "underperforming" for their number of followers, versus funds like Andreessen or Lightspeed.</li></ul><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/WWBxHFL/image-6.png alt></p><ul><li>We are definitely finding clusters in the types of words that VCs use. We are working to look at trends over time, as well as how words used on Twitter relate to words used on VC websites. But one fun finding is that tweets involving "Thank You's" are by far the most popular in terms of engagement. That's the Klingon starship looking custer in the graph below.</li></ul><p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/Fq85rgJ/image-8.png alt></p><h2 id=heading></h2><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://haplescent.github.io/VCX-blog/>&copy; VCX 2021</a><div></div></div></footer></body></html>
