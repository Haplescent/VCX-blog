## **VC Marketing Jam #2 â€“ &quot;Content, Content, NFTs, Oh My!&quot; (3/17/21)**

Venture capitalists need to be seen as thought leaders, and content is the way to make that happen. Some VCs are even starting their own publishing platforms. But creating compelling original content isn&#39;t easy. Harder still is creating content that will spread far and wide. Or is it? Influencers are using their powerful communities to promote content and to drive up the value of everything from startups to SPACs to...you guessed it... NFTs! The meteoric rise of NFTs in recent months gives tantalizing clues as to how ideas spread through the Valley and beyond. Deeper still, NFT&#39;s present a new way to value content and create revenue for content creators.

Join us on 3/17 at 6:30 PM Pacific for a deep dive into content and NFTs. Co-hosts [Brian Dema](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandema/) and [Kristen Ostro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristenostro/) are joined by speakers including [Ben Worthen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAZ9fkBAfMgECHG4BbeTu8duOvDIxSXXeU?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BIvEreboxSsSOgb46ZcEqvA%3D%3D), [Alexa Makreas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAW4vq8BVjm7n_JWzDr_8ws5jHXAbUBUC3g), [Han de Jong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAASIIVEBi1dRs-3-Lc46N7WT0jp87kVa_Tk), [Mandy Campbell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAACn6fUB_28tdAXDb3PA04_AxRo-Dt1WN14), and [John Merritt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAoIknQBn7CVE47vdkbUvb0BfexOXzkKRCI) .

&quot;**YAKATA&quot; NFT Drop!**

We will also be debuting &quot;YAKATA&quot;, an audio collectible now available on both the [Rarible](https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:448059:0x0f6fc4e00de0b7bdf3241045546dda635b3d7863) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/448059) marketplaces. This was our first foray into making an NFT. Check it out to hear the story behind the song and to bid!

Google Trends data showing how new the NFT conversation is!

Our own research into Twitter data shows a similar spike in the conversation in the last two months. This data is based on the same &quot;DeepTech 45&quot; network that we discussed in our last episode (see **VC Marketing Jam #1 Research** below).

Map of Twitter relationships among our sample DeepTech 45 network containing the term &quot;NFT&quot;. Large dots interact/are interacted with more in tweets than small dots. If an arrow points towards someone, it means that this person was mentioned (can be just a &#39;mention&#39;, a retweet, or a reply to your tweet). The people doing the tweeting about NFTs are at the origin of the arrows. This is not representing the flow of the Tweets themselves. For instance, &quot;JoinClubhouse&quot; does not necessarily tweet a lot about NFTs, but rather it is get tagged often in tweets about NFTs.

## **VC Marketing Jam #1 (3/2/21)**

Our inaugural conversion on marketing for venture capital, led by Kristen Ostro and Brian Dema, and a group of VC marketers, platform experts and data scientists.

We the rising importance of personal branding for VC partners, and the need for authenticity. In other words, people are what really matter (thanks for that one [Erik Adcock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAQFLpwBKAL7I87SkCIg8YBbBooDktwtcCo/)!). We heard cool stats on the venture Twitter-sphere and &quot;information centricity&quot; - a measure of who is at the center of the conversation and why.

Thanks again to our co-hosts, [Brian Dema](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandema/) and [Kristen Ostro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristenostro/), and to all of our speakers: [Annie Le](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leannie/), [Heather Harder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hharder/), [Tuan Pham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phamt/), [Neha Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nehaksingh/), [Theron McCollough](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theronmccollough/), [John Merritt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-merritt-58445b48/), [Han de Jong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/han-de-jong-01556721/), [Angela Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinangela/), [Erik Adcock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-adcock-8247081a/) and [Margarita Golod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaritagolod/)!

Big shout out to [Nate Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathandwilliams/) for jumping in to give the GP perspective and more on the [UNION Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/53182808/) story.

**Research** :

We referenced a recent study by the VCX team of the Twitter network surrounding a sample of 45 DeepTech-focused VCs. Key figures are below (contact us if you would like the full study). We used a number of data science techniques (including principle component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization for topic analysis and clustering - that&#39;s a mouthful!) to determine how information flows through this sample VC network in Twitter.

We have developed a concept called &quot;information centrality&quot;, which is a measure for how well tweets propagated throughout the secondary network surrounding these VCs. This methodology presents an intriguing way to map the venture capital conversation online. We are currently working to expand this analysis across the entire VC community globally.

We are already findings results on how various VCs perform in terms of engagement, including which VCs may be underperforming given their community size. Even more interesting is where this data will lead... we are already seeing connections to important diversity issues facing venture, as well as trends in word usage which exemplify the VC &quot;echo chamber&quot;. See this [Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/explore-175-years-of-words-in-scientific-american/)for an interesting use case of a similar types of topic analysis.

Other interesting findings include:

- 7:00 PM Pacific is apparently the best time to Tweet with this audience.

- Original content may be overrated - retweets get retweeted MUCH more often than original tweets.

- Likes and retweet count correlate strongly with each other.

![](https://i.ibb.co/7KByKzb/image-7.png)

- The relationship between follower count and tweet engagements is not linear. Some firms (perhaps Kleiner) could be relatively &quot;underperforming&quot; for their number of followers, versus funds like Andreessen or Lightspeed.

![](https://i.ibb.co/WWBxHFL/image-6.png)

- We are definitely finding clusters in the types of words that VCs use. We are working to look at trends over time, as well as how words used on Twitter relate to words used on VC websites. But one fun finding is that tweets involving &quot;Thank You&#39;s&quot; are by far the most popular in terms of engagement. That&#39;s the Klingon starship looking custer in the graph below.
